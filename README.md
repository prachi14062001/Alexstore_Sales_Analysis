## Business Performance Over Time

### Year-over-Year Growth

2015:
- Sales: -2.88%
- Profit: +24.40%
- Margin improved from 10.23% to 13.09%

Insight:
Despite a slight revenue decline, profitability increased significantly. This indicates margin expansion driven by cost optimization, better pricing strategy, or reduction of low-margin sales.

2016:
- Sales: +29.47%
- Profit: +32.77%
- Margin: 13.42% (Peak)

Insight:
2016 was the strongest year operationally. Both revenue and profit grew at healthy rates, with profit outpacing sales — indicating scalable and efficient growth.

2017:
- Sales: +20.36%
- Profit: +14.23%
- Margin softened to 12.74%

Insight:
Growth continued, but profit grew slower than revenue, suggesting mild margin compression. This may be due to increased discounts, category mix shifts, or seasonal promotional pressure.

Strategic Conclusion:
The business improved efficiency from 2014 to 2016 and maintained structural strength in 2017 despite slight margin pressure.

## Category-Level Analysis

Highest Revenue Category:
Office Supplies
- Sales: $1M
- Profit: $142.26K
- Margin: 11%

Highest Profit Margin Category:
Furniture
- Sales: $590K
- Profit: $96.53K
- Margin: 16.35%

Key Insight:
Although Office Supplies generates the highest revenue, Furniture delivers the strongest margins. This indicates stronger pricing power and better cost efficiency in Furniture.

Technology:
- Lowest sales among categories
- Margin: ~11%
- Average Discount: 16%

Insight:
Technology appears structurally weaker, contributing lower revenue and compressed margins despite aggressive discounting.

---

## Discount Analysis

Average Discount:
- Furniture: 15%
- Technology: 16%
- Office Supplies: 16%

Insight:
Discount levels are similar across categories, yet Furniture maintains higher margins. This suggests superior pricing power or cost structure in that segment.

## Sub-Category Insights

Top 3 Most Profitable Sub-Categories:
1. Furnishings – $63,416
2. Paper – $30,607
3. Binders – $30,195

Most Profitable Product:
Contemporary Wood/Metal Frame (Furnishings) – $25,000

Loss-Making Sub-Category:
Copiers – -$386

Insight:
Profit concentration is visible in specific sub-categories, particularly Furnishings. The Copier segment requires review for pricing or cost inefficiencies.

---

## Seasonal Trends

- Highest sales observed in Quarter 4 every year.
- November shows peak sales but only 10% margin.
- October shows a temporary dip before Q4 spike.

Insight:
Q4 performance appears promotion-driven. Revenue increases, but margins compress, suggesting discount-led seasonal growth.

---
